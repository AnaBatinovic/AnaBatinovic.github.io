I"<p>Proposed multi-resolution frontier-based planner is a real-time capable exploration planner. The planner consists of the algorithm for detecting frontier points, followed by clustering of frontier points and selecting the best frontier point to be explored. Performance is achieved by not relying on data obtained directly from the 3D sensor, but on data obtained by a mapping algorithm. In order to cluster the frontier points, the properties of the Octree environment representation are used, which allows easy analysis with different resolutions.</p>

<p>The frontier-based exploration planner is capable of autonomously exploring a previously unknown area, creating an occupancy grid map using Cartographer SLAM and generating an OctoMap. The planner does not require any prior knowledge of the environment, except for boundaries of the area to be explored. The planner may be applied to both indoor and outdoor environments.</p>

<p>It ensures frontiers detection, clustering and selection of the best frontier (a new target point). In each iteration, map and OctoMap are updated. Frontiers are clustered and a new target point is selected only when the prevoius target is reached. A robust frontier detection speeds up the exploration process, while a clustering algorithm ensures target evaluation in the real time.</p>

<p>The best frontier point to be visited is determined by estimating the benefit of the information gathered by visiting a candidate frontier point. The exploration loop is closed with an autonomous navigation to the selected frontier point, using the map generated through the exploration for trajectory planning and localization. Furthermore, the planner maintains a occupancy map of the environment. This guarantees that paths are only planned within free space, while giving a notion on exploration progress.</p>

<h2 id="exploration-in-progress">Exploration in progress</h2>
<p>During an unknown area exploration, the frontier-based planner publishes data on a number of topics. The ROS package RViz is used in order to visualize map, voxels (free and occupied) and paths.</p>

<p>Frontier points are marked red, candidates (clustered points) are yellow while the best frontier voxel is marked pink. The UAV planned a path (green) to the best frontier voxel (target point). OctoMap of the environment is updated in each iteration.</p>
